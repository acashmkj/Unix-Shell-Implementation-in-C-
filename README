The file.cpp contains the main function which takes the input from user and checks it for pipeline. If pipeline exist it processes the data separately else it passes the data to the functions. 

int startprocess(char arr[], int i)
This function is the initial function which is called for checking the REDIRECTIONS. It passes the processed output to function process

int process(char arr[])
This function does the major part of the program. It tokenizes and checks for various possibilities of commands. The types of commands that are checked are as under:
1) Internal commands: pwd and cd
2) echo commands, setting and getting environment variables
3) history
4) ! : (i) !number (ii) !string (iii) !!
5) External commands
